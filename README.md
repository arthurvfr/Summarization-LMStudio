# Summarization-LMStudio
Program capable of summarizing the contents of a .txt file using a LLM and RAG.

The program is able to transcribe an audio or video file and use the transcription to generate a summary of it.

You must have LMStudio downloaded to your machine and change the LLM model to whatever you are going to use

For this project I'm using some LLM models, in the lines of code that have the model name, just change it to the model you will use
