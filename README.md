# Summarization-LMStudio
Program capable of summarizing the contents of a .txt file using a LLM and RAG.

You must have LMStudio downloaded to your machine and change the LLM model to whatever you are going to use

For this project I'm using the QwQ-32B LLM model, in the lines of code that have the model name, just change it to the model you will use

The mainBase.py file is the file I used initially and from it I made the testTXT.py file, which is the file that summarizes a .txt file
